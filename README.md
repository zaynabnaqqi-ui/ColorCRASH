# ColorCRASH 🎮

A cognitive skills training game disguised as a fast-paced color-matching arcade experience. Built with C++ and Raylib.

## Problem Statement:

Mobile phones have become almost a part of every child's life. They play violent video games almost all the time. The impact? Detrimental. More kids are diagnosed with multiple cognitive problems. But the solution doesn't rely on complete withdrawal. 

Children and adults alike often struggle with improving their reaction time, peripheral vision, and decision-making under pressure in a fast-paced, non-stressful environment. Existing reaction-time games can be generic or lack a clear progression system.

## Solution:

ColorCRASH is an arcade-style game where you control a character on a grid of colored tiles. Each round, a target color is displayed, and you must move your character to stand on the correct tile before the timer runs out. 

**Think of it as "Floor is Lava"... but Colorful!**

- **Dynamic Obstacles:** Fireballs that increase with each round
- **Color Switch Mechanic:** Keeps you on your toes in advanced levels
- **Power-Up System:** Potion power-ups that highlight the target color
- **Cognitive Training:** Improves reaction time, color recognition, and quick decision-making
- **Immersive Experience:** Sound effects and visual feedback for every game state

## How to Play:
